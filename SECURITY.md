SECURITY POLICY
================

Thank you for taking the time to help keep Destronia's AdBlock Filter repository secure.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this repository or its published filter lists, please follow the responsible disclosure process below so maintainers can triage and fix issues promptly.

Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------

- Preferred method: Use GitHub's private security advisories/reporting flow ("Report a vulnerability"). This lets maintainers communicate privately and receive attachments securely.
- If you cannot use the GitHub reporting flow, open a private email to the maintainers (see "Maintainer contact" below). Avoid filing a public issue or PR that includes exploit details.

What to include in your report
------------------------------

Please provide enough information for maintainers to reproduce and triage the issue. Useful information includes:

- A clear summary of the problem and where it occurs (file names, filter names, or URLs).
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal reproduction. If the issue depends on a specific site, include the URL and the page context.
- Expected vs actual behavior.
- Any PoC (proof-of-concept) code or screenshots. If sensitive, share them through the private reporting channel (GitHub or encrypted email).
- Your contact information and whether you want to be notified when the issue is fixed.

Handling and timelines
----------------------

- Maintainers will acknowledge receipt within 7 calendar days when possible.
- For valid security issues, maintainers will aim to provide a timeline for a fix and coordinate when to publicly disclose the issue.
- If a fix requires updating distributed filter lists (files under `filters/`), a coordinated release may be scheduled to minimize user disruption.

Maintainer contact
------------------

Use the GitHub "Report a vulnerability" button on this repository for private reports. If necessary, you may also contact repository maintainers via the email address listed in the project README or the maintainer's GitHub profile. Maintainers are not required to accept unsolicited encrypted messages, but PGP-encrypted reports are welcome if the maintainer has published a key.

Public disclosure
-----------------

Do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities until maintainers have had reasonable time to respond and a fix or mitigation has been released. If you plan to publicly disclose, please coordinate with maintainers and provide a reasonable disclosure window.

Additional notes
----------------

- This project accepts contributions under the terms of the repository license (see `LICENSE`). Security fixes that require code or rule changes may be accepted as pull requests from any contributor, but avoid posting exploit details in public PRs or issues.
- For high-severity issues affecting many users, maintainers may escalate to GitHub security or other channels as needed.

Thank you again for helping keep users safe.
